# Version : 1.1 - Now unloads launchd plists at the suggestion of Tom Bridge
# Version : 1.2 - Now forgets installer pkgs at the suggestion of Francois Leveaux-Tiffreau

# Now recursively unload all these

# Calculate the length of the launchd array.

# Loop around the array and delete the files/folders.
