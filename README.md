# Remove-AV

# Scripts to forcibly delete various macOS AV products

I was sadly in the position where I had to remove existing AV products and replace with a standardised product.
The issue was that I didn't know (and had no way to find out) what AV products were being used!

There is a good chance I would only be dealing with the "free" products out there, so i've chosen to concentrate on those.

Run these over the loginwindow as root. I've also provided some basic Casper EA's so that you can control when these scripts are used.

Hope this helps someone else out there. Untested as of Monday 24th October 2016.
